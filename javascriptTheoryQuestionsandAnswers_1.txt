Ques 1: What is function currying
Ans 1: Currying in JavaScript is a process in functional programming in which we can
transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nesting functions. 
It returns a new function that expects the next argument inline.

In other words, instead of a function taking all arguments at one time, 
it takes the first one and returns a new function, which takes the second one 
and returns a new function, which takes the third one, and so on, until all 
arguments have been fulfilled.

Foreg:
function sum(a) {
    return (b) => {
        return (c) => {
            return a + b + c;
        }
    }
}
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3));
