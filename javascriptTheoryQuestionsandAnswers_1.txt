Ques 1: What is function currying
Ans 1: Currying in JavaScript is a process in functional programming in which we can
transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nesting functions. 
It returns a new function that expects the next argument inline.

In other words, instead of a function taking all arguments at one time, 
it takes the first one and returns a new function, which takes the second one 
and returns a new function, which takes the third one, and so on, until all 
arguments have been fulfilled.

Foreg:
function sum(a) {
    return (b) => {
        return (c) => {
            return a + b + c;
        }
    }
}
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3));

QUES 2: What are higer order functions ?
ANSWER 2: Higher order functions are those functions that takes another functions
as an arguments(callbacks) or returns another functions.
Foreg: map function
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function (number) {
  return number * 2;
});
console.log(doubledNumbers); // Outputs: [2, 4, 6, 8]

QUES 3: How to check  object is empty or not ?
ANS 3:
    1st method - Using Object.keys(yourObjectName) - This is introduced in ES6. This 
    will convert the object keys into array and by checking the length we can check object
    is empty or not.
    For Eg.
    let obj = {name:'Prabhat',age:31};
    let obj1 = {};
    Object.keys(obj) //['name','age']
    Object.keys(obj).length // returns 2
    Object.keys(obj1).length // returns 0

    2nd method - Using for..in loop - We can use this loop with hasOwnProperty to check
    object is empty not.
    For eg.
    let obj = {name:'Prabhat',age:31};
    let obj1 = {};
    const res = (objName) => {
        for(let prop in objName) {
            if(objName.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
                return true
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    console.log(res(obj)) //returns true;
    console.log(res(obj2)) //returns false;

    3rd Method - Using JSON.stringify(yourObjectName) - If the object is empty then it
    will return '{}'
    For eg
    let obj1 = {name:'prabhat'};
    let obj2 = {};
    const res = JSON.stringify(obj2);
    if(res === '{}'){
    console.log('object is empty')
    } else {
    console.log("object is not empty");
    }
