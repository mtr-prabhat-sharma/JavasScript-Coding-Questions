A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of 
Last In First Out (LIFO). 
This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.
Pushing an item on the top is called PUSH.
Removing an item (from the top) is called POP.

Some basic operations to perform actions on the stack.
1 - PUSH: Defined above
2 - POP: Defined above
3 - isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
4 - isFull: Check if the stack is full
5 - Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it
