Arrow functions are not hoisted in JavaScript because they behave differently 
from regular functions in terms of how they capture the this value and because 
of their more concise syntax.

Hoisting in JavaScript is the process where variable and function declarations are 
moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation. This means you can 
use a function or a variable before it's declared in the code.

However, arrow functions are not hoisted because they are treated as variables rather 
than function declarations. They are part of the expression syntax. When you define 
an arrow function, it's essentially equivalent to assigning a function expression to 
a variable. For example:

// This is a regular function declaration and is hoisted
function regularFunction() {
  // ...
}

// This is an arrow function assigned to a variable and is not hoisted
const arrowFunction = () => {
  // ...
};

Arrow functions capture the this value from their containing lexical context, 
which is where they are defined. This behavior is different from regular functions, 
which have their this value determined when they are called. As a result, arrow 
functions rely on their surrounding context, and hoisting them could lead to 
unexpected behavior.

To avoid any confusion, it's a good practice to define arrow functions before you 
use them, just like you would with any other variable or constant declaration.
